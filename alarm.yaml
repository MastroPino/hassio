code: !secret alarm_code #Code, should consist of one or more digits ie 6482
panic_code: !secret panic_code #[OPTIONAL] Panic Code should consist of one or more digits ie 9876, it needs to be different to your standard alarm code. This enables a special panic mode. This can be used under duress to deactivate the alarm which would appear to the unseeing eye as deactivated however a special attribute [panic_mode] listed under the alarm_control_panel.[identifier] will change to ACTIVE. This status could be used in your automations to send a notification to someone else police/spouse/sibling/neighbour that you are under duress. To deactive this mode arm then disarm your alarm in the usual manner. 

pending_time: 25 #Grace time in seconds to allow for exit and entry using Away mode
trigger_time: 600

alarm: automation.alarm_triggered
warning: automation.alarm_warning

#[OPTIONAL SETTINGS] 
clock: True  #[Optional] - False by default. True enables a clock in the center of the status bar
perimeter_mode: False #[Optional] - False by default. True enables perimeter mode, this could be known as 'Day Mode' i.e. only arm the doors whilst there is someone using all floors
weather: False #[Optional] - False by Default. Allows a weather summary to be displayed on the status bar. Dark Sky weather component must be enabled with the name sensor.dark_sky_summary
settings: True #[OPTIONAL] True/False. Enables a settings mode which allows you to define certain settings in the UI without the need to restart HA after certain config changes. This will be used for fluid settings such as enabling/disabling the screensaver mode once implmented. NOTE for this to work you will need to create a directory within your HA config directory named 'alarm_settings' this is where the settings file will be managed. Also ensure you have the appropriate permissions/ownership for the HA user to create/amend the file.
#hide_all_sensors: True #[NOT IN USE YET, Optional] - False by default. Setting this to True hides the 'All Sensors' box which displays every sensor when in disarmed mode.

#[MQTT RELATED]
mqtt: False #[OPTIONAL] - False by default. Settings this to True will enable MQTT Mode. Uncomment options below to use See the README for guidance.
#state_topic: home/alarm #[OPTIONAL] The MQTT topic HA will publish state updates to.
#command_topic: home/alarm/set [OPTIONAL] The MQTT topic HA will subscribe to, to receive commands from a remote device to change the alarm state.
#qos: 0 #[OPTIONAL] The maximum QoS level for subscribing and publishing to MQTT messages. Default is 0.
#payload_disarm: "DISARM" #[OPTIONAL] The payload to disarm this Alarm Panel. Default is “DISARM”.
#payload_arm_home: "ARM_HOME" #[OPTIONAL] The payload to set armed-home mode on this Alarm Panel. Default is “ARM_HOME”.
#payload_arm_away: "ARM_AWAY" #[OPTIONAL] The payload to set armed-away mode on this Alarm Panel. Default is “ARM_AWAY”.
#payload_arm_night: "ARM_NIGHT" #[OPTIONAL] The payload to set armed-night mode on this Alarm Panel. Default is “ARM_NIGHT”.

# Use this group to automatically override the warning message on open sensors when setting 'away' mode. (I use this as I have a motion sensor at the front door)
override:
  - binary_sensor.hall_multi_sensor_sensor

# This group is special and only effects 'perimeter mode'. If perimeter_mode is enabled then any sensor in this group will trigger the alarm immediately if arm perimeter is set. There is no delayed group for this mode (unless requested as a feature of course!)
